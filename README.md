<br/>
In this video we are going to build a complete web application from scratch. It is going to have the backend in Express.js and frontend in React.

In the first part of this tutorial, we'll set up a backend server. You'll learn how to create a backend server, create routes, handle HTTP requests, and set up API that our frontend can communicate with. Once our backend is up and running, we'll move on to the frontend, where we’ll learn how to make asynchronous requests to our backend API, retrieve data, and update the UI.

By the end of this video, you'll have a fully functional web application wherein the frontend would be communicating with backend seamlessly.
